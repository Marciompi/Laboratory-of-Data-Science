Laboratory project on building a Data Warehouse on tennis matches

Project for the university exam "Laboratory Data Science".The aim of the project is to create an ETL process starting from the data manipulation by using python to elaborate and partition the csv source file. After it I use Microsoft SQL Server and Visual Studio to organize the Data Warehouse and implement sql queries. Therefore I build up a Cube and apply MDX queries. Finally there is the visualization of the data obtained with Microsoft Power BI.
